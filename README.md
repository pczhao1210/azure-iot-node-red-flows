Please note this repo contains multiple node-red flow samples to send data from Node-Red to Azure IoT Hub or Azure IoT Central.

( Important!! ) Several tasks need to be done before using these sample flows:
- Install Node-Red, you can find the official install guide [here](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/)
- Install the nodes listed in the [useful-nodes](useful-nodes.md), fell free to use [Palette Manager with UI](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/palette/manager) or [NPM](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/adding-nodes#installing-with-npm)
- Import the node and enjoy, instructions can be found [here](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export)
